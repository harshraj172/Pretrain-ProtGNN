# Transformer-COVID

### AGENDA 01:
   **AIM : To classify the Binding Energy of an Antibody with an Antigen**
   
   #### Overview
   1. Use A pretrained Transformer to get feature representation of the protein sequence.
   2. This feature representation is given as input along with the contact map of the 3D-Structure to a GNN model.
   3. Combine the final feature representation of every node,
   4. Add a classification head over the combined output.
